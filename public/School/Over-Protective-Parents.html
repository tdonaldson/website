<h1>Overprotective Parents</h1></div>

<p>When I came home from Tom’s house one mid-summer afternoon, there was something that had happened at his house that I needed to talk to my parents about. It was about a substance they had not discussed with me. That substance was drugs. I called my parents, Carla and John, out to the front room and shared with them that Tom had offered drugs to me that afternoon while I was at his house. Before I was able to tell them that I had not accepted the drugs, my mother jumped off of the couch and began yelling at me. She was bellowing orders like “I do not want you at his house anymore” and “You are not allowed to talk to him until we have talked to Tom’s parents.” After a few minutes of dealing with the overreaction of my mother, she sent me to my room to think while they discussed the situation at hand. I never did get an explanation of why my mom overreacted.</p>

<p>While lying on my bed after being sent to my room, I began to think about other possible matters, other than drugs, that my parents could be hiding from me. After thinking about the things in life and then determining exactly how overprotective my parents were of me, I came to the realization that nothing seemed clear to me anymore: I knew absolutely nothing about anything that I could become involved in – especially about drugs.</p>

<p>Parents in this day and age are unwilling to talk to their children about things they could become involved in. The cause of this is that the parents do not want their children to be just like them. The parents may have had a drug addiction and they do not want their children to have to go through the same thing. Since the parents are not sharing what could happen to them if they were to become involved with drugs, their children are going behind their parent’s backs and hiding it from them after they find out for themselves.</p> 

<p>When the parent overprotects the child, this will affect him in the long run. Several things can happen due to “protecting” a child. The child may be completely oblivious to drugs until they are out on their own. If they were to find out about drugs through their friends, the child may begin to rebel against his parents. Also, depending on how long the child is hidden and how protective his parents are, there is the possibility that he will be emotionally scarred.
If the child were to find out about drugs after they have left their parents and are living alone, there is not going to be anyone there to support him. If drugs were to make an appearance, the now grown-up child would more than likely become addicted. He would not have the support to stay away from drugs. At this point, would you, as the parent, be happy with yourself knowing that the child is now a drug user? This could have been stopped if you would not have “protected” him from drugs while he was living in your household.</p>

<p>There is the strong possibility though, especially if the child is attending a public school, that drugs will appear to him through his friends. If this were to happen, the child, if he is comfortable with talking to his parents, he will approach them and ask them about drugs. Through the parents’ advice to the child, he may be less likely to fall into the drug user category. If he had tried drugs before talking with his parents, this gives the parents the chance to tell the child that drugs are not good for the human and that he should not continue partaking in them.</p>

<p>Depending on how long drugs are hidden from the child and also depending on how protective the parents are, the child has the chance to become emotionally scarred for the rest of his life. This is the most severe case of overprotective parenting. For this to happen, the parents would be making all the decisions for the child. The child would more than likely be homeschooled and would not participate in any activity outside of the home. The parents would be watching his every movement. The parent would be pre-reading books or magazine articles that the child desires to read. If there is something within the reading that the parent thinks is unacceptable for the child, he would not be allowed to become divulged in that reading. For example, one book that my parents kept from me was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. At that time, I did not realize the coarse language that was used in that novel. The innuendos in the book were also a contributing factor to me not being allowed to read it. My parents also did not wish for me to see how Huck, the main character, goes behind the backs of all the people in his hometown to free his friend from slavery. They did not want me to get any ideas.</p> 

<p>If everything in life were to be hidden from the child in this way, there would be serious issues when he finds out when he is out on his own. The child would go into mental shock and he would be completely baffled by his revelation. The child would not know what to do. He would probably go through an emotional breakdown.</p>

<p>Even though I was sheltered, I did not have to endure much shock. I was more stunned that my parents had not talked to me about something that is so important. Although, through this issue with Tom, my parents talked to me about drugs and what could happen to me. My parents also came to the conclusion that they needed to start telling me about other things that they did not want me to become involved in. Through my revelation with drugs, my parents became less protective of me and more open with me.</p>
