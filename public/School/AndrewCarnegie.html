<h1>Andrew Carnegie<h1></div>
	
	<p>Andrew Carnegie was born on November 25, 1835 in Dunfermline, England.  Andrew’s education was extremely informal. For the most part, he taught himself through the library that he helped organize weekly. The librarian would allow Andrew to borrow books from the library so he could learn the necessities of life. Even though he worked in the library, this was not considered his first job. His first occupation was that of working as a bobbin boy in a sewing shop in Pennsylvania at the age of thirteen. During that time, his weekly wage was a dollar and twenty-five cents.</p>
	<p>I admire Andrew Carnegie for several reasons. The first reason is that he gave his whole being in everything that he did. For me though, his dedication is mostly shown through his desire to learn. Even though he had no one to push him, he gave up his time to learn how to execute tasks that would help him advance in the business world. These tasks included learning the ways of the economy and the use of the telegraph, which was the way of mass communication during the time of the railroad industry.</p>
	<p>The second motive for my admiration of Andrew Carnegie is that he was risky with his hard earned money and invested it into a company. The company he invested his money in was Adams Express, which was a railroad construction company. This company would later on move him far into the industry of railroad and steel, which would make him an extremely wealthy businessman. Risking one’s hard earned wages is something not many people in the twenty-first century want to do. Seeing this back in a time where money was not the easiest thing to come by and not seeing that act as much now, it has given me the inspiration and the ability to admire what he had to have given up to take a risk to become an entrepreneur.</p>
	<p>The final purpose for my admiring of Mr. Carnegie is that of his forming the businesses The Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Works. These two companies would become the bridge to progressing into the creation of modern weapons for the military. Carnegie’s businesses would also lead to the idea of automobiles. Through his idea of mixing iron and oil to create steel, Andrew was able to move along the progression of trains and the tracks that would carry the trains from coast to coast. The train-tracks would be more safe and less rigid after his ideas were approved.</p> 
	<p>One event that I believe sparked Carnegie’s success was his learning of how to use the telegraph. Through the use of the telegraph, he was able to secure a job at the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Even though he was only an operator of a telegraph at the age of sixteen, he had become the superintendent of the company’s division in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. This achievement was because of his success in securing shipments to and from different companies and also for his ideas for the railroad.</p>
	<p>To emulate the life of Andrew Carnegie in my life would be a difficult task. One possible object that I could institute into my life would be that of investing in the stock market or put my trust into companies that I trust. Doing this could help in my progression in the business world and if I am as lucky as Andrew Carnegie, I could possibly become a great entrepreneur.</p>
	<p>Another possible article that could become part of my life is his devotion to learning. By taking the time to learn about different abilities that could help me in a business could help me advance farther into that business, or industry. Also, learning about how an object or the process of a business works could help me become a successful business person.</p>
	<p>A third detail that I could implement in my life that Andrew Carnegie showed in his life could be the desire to help others. After Andrew retired in 1901 from the steel industry, he began distributing his wealth to different universities. He also formed Carnegie Institute of Technology, which is now built into the Carnegie Mellon University. Donations to libraries to further their finding informative books was another way that he helped others. Lastly, he funded organizations to help with the education of the African-American people. This is probably the most important aspect that needs to be implemented in my life.</p>
	<p>Andrew Carnegie, in his day, was one of the most successful businesspeople for several reasons. He invested money in companies, he funded the furtherance of education, and he also devoted his life to the progression of the steel and railroad industries.</p></body>
