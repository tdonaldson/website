<h1>Should There Be Sex Before Marriage?</h1></div>

<p>Premarital sex is an activity that should be constrained: sex should be an activity that is saved until two people are united through marriage. Sexual activity can drive a man or woman to begin to crave it. A man begins searching for other sex-driven people to satisfy his needs when his significant other decides she does not desire to have sex when he wants it; likewise for a woman. If sex were to be saved until marriage, the lives of many people – mostly teenagers and young adults – would be improved. There will not be as many broken hearts and depression would be far less widespread. The amount of single parents would begin to decrease.</p> 

<p>When premarital sex is brought up for discussion among teenagers, teens tend to argue that they need to prove to their significant other that they love them. Also, they – most often men – do not wish to appear as novices on their wedding night. Teens also argue “what’s wrong with having protected sex?” One of the biggest arguments towards premarital sex is that the couple believes that they are engaged and will be married soon, why should they wait for that special day to arrive?</p>

<p>When teenagers are questioned about premarital sex, the argument of proving their love for each other is bound to come up; but, humans are able to prove their love for another person through ways other than by satisfying another’s sexual desires. Love can be shown through how a person cares for the other. He can also give gifts to his significant other. A man can also share his love for a woman by being there for her when everything in life is going wrong: when she needs a shoulder to cry on or someone to talk to.</p>

<p>Men tend to have egotistical minds, especially when it comes to their sexual abilities. A man has the tendency to not want to appear to his newlywed wife as a novice in the bedroom. He wants to show that he knows what he is doing. What the man also wants to do is make sure all of his parts are working correctly. Test driving a new car before purchasing it is the same thing. The person buying the car desires to know that the body of the car is in mint condition. But what the person does not think about is that the body is not the most important part of the car: the engine is. The engine should be checked to see if it will reliable. But there is a chance later down the road that the engine may not work properly. The same thing goes for the a man’s organs. While “test driving” one night, everything may work as planned and as it is supposed to; but when it comes to the “drive” with his soon-to-be-spouse, some mistakes and problems arise that cause him not to work properly.</p> 

<p>Not wanting to appear as a novice, a man is willing to go behind his fiancés back and “practice” sex with other women. If the man’s fiancé does not want to participate in sexual activity in the first place, she will not care if you are not a seasoned veteran in sexual activity. If the man and woman are already engaged, this is practically the same as having an affair while being married. Depending on the woman’s sexual desire, she may be extremely upset and would more than likely call off the wedding because her soon-to-be-husband is cheating on her. Practicing sex is not a justifiable reason to cheat. No woman wants a man who is going to cheat on her; her thought would be: “There is nothing stopping him from continuing to cheat after the wedding, so why continue on if all I am going to do is become disappointed and hurt?” Is becoming “an expert” in sexual activity really worth losing a woman over?</p>

<p>One of the biggest arguments that is brought up among discussion when young adults talk about premarital sex is the fact that they are engaged and will be married soon, what is the reason to wait until after that day? The problem here is that having sex before marriage can cause the man and woman to have difficulties in their relationship. These difficulties can be that the sexual activity makes the couple realize that they are becoming less attached and their love for each other is decreasing daily. The decrease of love is actually a result of non-bonding chemicals in the brain that are released during the act of sex. These two chemicals – oxytocin and vasopressin, commonly referred to as voles – are the key. If these two chemicals in the brain do not merge together, the two people who had sex begin to repel each other because of the in-balance of oxytocin and vasopressin in their brains. What can happen is either the man or woman, or both, begin to feel an odd tension growing in their relationship. That tension then builds into and makes an awkward feeling when the couple is spending time with each other. Through the awkwardness, the couple begins to argue about petty crap – being on time to a date, not answering phone calls or text messages in a timely fashion, and school or work is getting in the way of the relationship. The couple begins to argue enough that they tick each other off to the point of completely halting their conversations for multiple days. While they are away from each other, they decide that they cannot live with each other. Through falling out of love with each other, the man and woman’s relationship will cease to exist.</p>

<p>Another argument that teens and young adults will consistently argue is that they are planning to use a condom each time they have sex. The truth is, having protected sex is just as morally wrong as having unprotected sex. Sure, with protected sex, pregnancy before marriage will be decreased, but this is what does not induce the bonding reaction between those two love-driving chemicals – oxytocin and vasopressin. Protected sex causes the chemicals to not come in contact with each other.</p> 

<p>Saving sex until marriage will also decrease the amount of single parents in the world. With premarital sex comes the possibility of unexpected pregnancy. With unexpected pregnancy comes the chance of one of the parents heading for the hills and not caring for the baby because they do not want to have the extra responsibility on their life. By not participating in sex before marriage, there would be a lower amount of children born outside of marriage, which leads to a lower amount of single parents. Children would not have to grow up without one of the two parents in their lives if only the parents would wait to participate in sexual intercourse until marriage.</p> 

<p>If sex were to be saved until the day of the wedding, the amount of broken hearts in teenagers and young adults – especially in women – would be far less. Furthermore, the amount would continually and consistently decrease. Then, depression in the lives of the new generation will be far less. Some young men tend to be sex maniacs and only want a female for that. The relationship between a man and a woman begins and the male coerces the female into sexual activities (sexual intercourse, oral sex, or mutual masturbation) within a few days of beginning the relationship. A few days after the new couple has their first sexual experience with each other, the woman receives a phone call saying that he does not want to continue with the relationship. His reason is because her sexual ability, the ability to arouse him sexually and to make sex enjoyable and sensational, is not good enough for him. After the phone call comes to an end, depression begins to sink into her life and she becomes more and more reluctant to find another man because she has been hurt. The mindset that all men are sex maniacs has now been instilled in her and she does not desire to be hurt any more than she already has been.</p>
 
<p>Abstaining from premarital sex can increase the happiness of people’s lives. It can also make a person less sex-craved and less active with the opposite sex during a relationship and also when a relationship does not exist in his life. Depression and hurt will decrease in the hearts of young men and women as well if sex were saved. Denying the opportunities to participate in unprotected sexual intercourse before marriage can decrease the amount of single parents in society.</p>
