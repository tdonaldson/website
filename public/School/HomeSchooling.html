<h1>Home Schooling</h1></div>

<p>Home schooling is a great way for your children to learn more. Your children will have the potential to be more intelligent through home schooling than by going to a public school because they do not have the peer pressure at home that they would more than likely face in a normal school. But your child should not be sheltered from the things that go on in the world. A bigger reason why your child could be more intelligent is because there are no distractions.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with what I believe is one of the greatest things about home schooling. That is that there are absolutely no distractions around the student. Sitting at home helps him or her stay away from the temptations of the world. A child, or teenager, is less likely to get involved with the wrong crowd. They are less likely to get caught up in the lifestyle that includes drugs, alcohol, and sex. Home schooling helps the student focus in on their school work, and in a way, allows them to learn more about the subjects that they are studying.</p>

<p>Something else about home schooling that makes it amazing is that it turns out that the student is teaching him- or herself more than their teacher is teaching them. Believe me I have learned this over the past thirteen years of my home schooling experience. It is not something that happens right off the bat. It is also something that is not extremely prevalent in the early education years. Being able to teach yourself begins to show itself when you reach junior high school. But by the time high school rolls around, the student should be able to teach him- or herself without the help of the teacher. Teaching themselves means that all the work that you, as the teacher, has to do is write down the daily lesson plans and tell the student to “go at it and if you need any help, come to me and I will help you to the best of my ability.”</p>

<p>Home schooling is also incredibly self-paced. What I mean by this is that you and your student will be able to choose how fast or how slow you can go through the textbooks. I, personally, was able to go through some subjects extremely fast, i.e. mathematics. On the other hand, I had to take other subjects slow, especially the foreign languages that I took. One factor that determines how fast the student goes through a subject is how interested they are in the discipline. But also, how fast they learn determines the speed at which they go through a subject. Along with home schooling being self-paced, you and your student are able to choose what time you wish to begin. You can get up early in the morning or, you can wake up in the afternoon. It depends on when you want the school work to be done by. Home schooling is extremely flexible in this area. There are no rules or regulations that determine this; most organizations, such as SCAIHS(South Carolina Association of Independent Home Schools) just requires you to have one hundred and eighty days of school completed.</p>

<p>A fourth reason that home schooling is enjoyable is because the student has all the one-on-one time that they want with the teacher. The student does not have to search for their teacher to setup a time that they can be met with. The teacher(s) are always there for the student because they are normally the parents of the student. The student also has the ability to take as much time with the teacher as they need instead of a set period of time such as thirty or forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Being home schooled can become very relaxing. Not only is it because the student can take their time to do the school work that is required of them that day, but they are able to do their work wherever they desire. If the student wants to be lazy one day, they can stay in their pajamas all day and stay in bed and complete their school work. There is not a dress code for being home schooled. With this wonderful item of knowledge, it is wonderful to know that the student does not have to spend extra time making sure that they look good to impress others when they go to a public school.</p>

<p>Home schooling is portrayed as being hard but in reality, it really is not hard. It is extremely easy. Not only because the student can relax, there are no distractions, or there is one-on-one time with the teacher, but it is easy because you do not have the extracurricular activities that public schools offer. For example, home schooling organizations such as Christian Homeschooler's Association of South Eastern South Carolina (CHASE SC) and SCAIHS do not offer sports (baseball, soccer, football, basketball, tennis, track), band, ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps), or clubs. Not having these extra activities that the student can become involved with helps keep the focus of the student on their school work instead of being focused on several different things at once.</p>

Home schooling is a wonderful way of learning. Your children will learn so many more things that they would not be taught in a public school. Along with the student learning, you, the parent, will gain plenty of knowledge.
