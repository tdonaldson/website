<h1>My Work Page</h1>
<p>
Good day all! You may bew thinking, "Why is he showcasing the work that he has done from the beginning of his HTML 
writing career?" Well, the answer is a simple one. I am posting these "projects" that I have done to simply show the 
progress that I have made. <a href="1-Starbuzz/index.html">Starbuzz</a> is where I began. Through the book I am 
using, <em><a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com">Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML</a></em>, I have done some minor tweaking
to each of the pages as the book has progressed. But, thankful to Elisabeth and Eric Freeman for writing the book, 
I have been able to create my own, from sratch pages; i.e. the home page and this page so far.
</p>
<p>
Well, it looks like that I am now completeted with the <em>Head First</em> book. It didn't take me too long to go through
the whole book. Kind of wish that it would have taken longer though. It was enjoyable while it lasted though. As of right
now, I am going to continually update my personal sites here on the site to hone my HTML skills.
</p>
<p>
Now, I am going to work on learning how to program computers. That's my next step in becoming a computer geek. Hopefully,
I will learn how to upload those programs onto the website so that all of you can test them out and tell me what you think.
