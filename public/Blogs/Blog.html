<h2>Why Should We Not Sin?</h2>
<p>After sitting in two church services today with the sermons being about loving one another, it struck me that before we
can even think about loving one another, we need to stray away from sinning. By sinning less, or attempting to sin less, a
person is putting self aside and that frees up the space in the person's heart to love others.</p>

<p>To help bring this less sinful life to come to fruition, there are five reasons I have found of why we should not sin:
<ul>
<li>Because the time spent in sin is forever wasted.</li>
<li>Because my sin never pleases but always grieves God who loves me.</li>
<li>Because my sin always makes me less than what I could be.</li>
<li>Because my sin may keep others from knowing Christ.</li>
<li>Because it is impossible to sin and follow the Spirit at the sae time.</li>
</ul>
So let's take these one at a time and divulge into detail with examples and verses from the Bible to support the reasons.</p>

<p>Let's first discuss that the time that we spend sinning is time that is going to be forever wasted. I'm going to add a 
little extra to that too. Let's actually say that the time is forever wasted and it won't prove to be of any good in the long
run!</p>
