<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Hello to my visitors. There isn't that much about this website. It's not a business website,
	but more of a hobby type thing I want to do.</p>
	<p>
		I've recently started learning how Ruby on Rails and so I'm going to be incorporating some of that 
		information into this website.

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p> My name is Tyler. I just turned 19 years old. I am a sophomore at Francis Marion University in Marion, South Carolina. 
I will be receiving my degree in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. <br /></p>
<p>Some of my hobbies include playing the piano, playing video games, and when I get the inspiration for something new, 
attempt to code my ideas, if it's within my realm of knowledge.</p>
<p>My first job, and my current job, is working as a shift supervisor at the local Cici's Pizza.</p>
