<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to my brand new, very first website! I'm not doing any type of sales or advertising on this page. I'm currently 
just using this website to become better at writing HTMLs. This will also help me prepare for classes that I will be taking 
during my college years. </p>
<p>As my days in learning and being more fluent in HTML, XHTML, and CSS grow, I plan on changing this mediocre website into
a site for a business. That business will be to advertise to others my ability to create web pages for their new, or old, 
businesses that they are wishing to advertise. That is not really in my new future; probably a year or two from now. That is,
unless I hone my abilities and am able to write web pages in my sleep.</p>

<div id="bio">
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p> My name is Tyler. I just turned 18 years old. I am a freshman at Francis Marion University in Marion, South Carolina. 
My major is a part of the business degree there at FMU; it is Management Information Systems(MIS). Management Information 
Systems is a subset of the overall internet controls of a business covering the application of people, documents, 
technologies, and procedures by management accountants to solve business problems such as costing a product, service or a 
business-wide strategy. <br /></p>
<p>I also play the piano; going on ten years now. I play all sorts of music. My least favorite to play is classical, not
sure why this is because I absolutely loving listening to the CDs that I own. I don't really like playing as an accompaniest.
I'd much rather be a solo pianist.</p>
<p>I am also working at the local Cici's Pizza. I have experience in every position within the restaurant. I will soon begin 
training to be a shift supervisor. This means that I will be able to run the restuarant as a manager and will have almost 
the same priviliges as a certified manager has.
