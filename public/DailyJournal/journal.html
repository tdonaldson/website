<h1>What's Happening In My Life</h1>
<p>Here's what I'm going to do with this page. I'm going to try to keep a journal of what I do every day up here on this page.
Once I start keeping more than one month's journal, I will only keep the most current entries on the main page and I will begin
linking the older entries to another page and according to the month in which I had created them. Not sure when I am going to
start putting up entries, but I'm hoping it will be soon: within the week more than likely.</p>
<p>Well, I hope that reading these might bring some interest to you and help you learn things about me that most people don't 
know.</p><br />

<h2>Tuesday, November 9, 2010</h2>
<p>Much of nothing happened to me today. Went out to school for one class, Computer Science. It was somewhat interesting but
not completely. From there, I went back into town and went to sit at work before having to clock in for the morning shift. My
boss and I, we sat there and talked about video games and movies. That's was fun.</p>

<p>Work wasn't too bad today though. We had an extremely busy lunch though. It made me extremely tired. An energy drink was a 
requirement of mine after I left work.</p>

<p>Some interesting things happened after work within my conversation with my best friend. I'm glad things are working out better
for her now. Even though she's probably not going to read this, it makes me extremely happy when she overcomes a problem in life.
It also makes me grateful to have her as a friend because through her, I can learn by example of how to get over an issue that
I could be going through. Thanks for that.</p>

<p>Didn't do much of anything else tonight. Mostly just studying...goodness was that boring! Oh well though. At least I'm 
learning something.</p>

<h2>Monday,November 8, 2010</h2>
<p>Well, well, well. What'dya know? It's the first day of the week and it's already looking like it is going to be a wonderful
week. Went to school at 8:30 this morning (that's always early no matter how long I do it). First class was English 112. Got my
paper back this morning that I turned in over a week ago. I made an 88 on that paper! It made me extremely happy to see that
because my papers, from my point of view, are not all that great but apparently my professor does not quite think that.</p>

<p>After English, I sat around for a while and helped a class mate out with her Chemistry Lab Report. Then, I went to math class.
That was kind of boring. Sat there and reviewed for the test that is coming up in two days. Seems like it's going to be pretty
easy. After math I had to go to Chemistry class. What fun! Not really. Tried to pay attention but my mind kept slipping to the
test that I had coming up next block...business.</p>

<p>I was not at all excited about having to go take a test in that class today; not one bit. But, it went fairly smooth. I 
feel confident enough to say that I think I did pretty dang good on that test. Maybe missed two or three questions at most. 
At least that's what I hope that's what I missed.</p>

<p>And now, sitting at home working on my English homework wishing it wouldn't take as long as it is but oh well. It'll be 
worth it in the end.</p>
